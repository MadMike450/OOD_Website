# OOD_Website
Objects of Desire - website

This was initially a group project for CSCI 480 at the University of Findlay.
Group members were Jason Rhubright, Matt Leese, Kevin Burdulis, and myself.

I simply took the project and added it to my own repository to tinker, update, fix, and find tune the website
for fun in my spare time.
